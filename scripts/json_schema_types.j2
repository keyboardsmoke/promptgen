Basic Types: JSON Schema supports several basic data types, including:

- `string` (for textual data)
- `number` (for numerical data)
- `integer` (for whole numbers)
- `boolean` (for true/false values)
- `null` (for the absence of any value)
- `array` (for an ordered list of items)
- `object` (for a collection of key-value pairs)
- `any` (indicating that any of the aforementioned types are valid)
